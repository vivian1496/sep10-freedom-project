            <h4>Robot waiters</h4>
            <h5> Instead of just human waiters our present  technology can  now also have robot waiters.
              These robots range from different looks, some restaurants prefer to make them look more human,
              some prefer to just make it look like a stand walking while others make them look cute.
              These robots can deliver food, take dirty dishes away, and they can sometimes even take orders depending on how advanced they are.
               However, these robots can’t take away the jobs of waiters just yet since they are expensive.</h5>

        <h4>Augmented Reality Menus </h4>

    <h5> With the simple click of your camera capturing the restaurant's QR code a 3D version of the food you want will show up on your screen.
        This can allow you to see how your food looks (how big it is, the colors, what's inside it). This is to lure people into buying it.
        The way it works is the website will already have a copy of the entire menu in 3D and all you have to do is scroll. </h5>

  <h4>Machine server</h4>
  <h5> In order for this innovation to work, restaurant tables will have to be bigger than they were before.
    In the middle of that table will be a dark magnetic circle that looks like plates.
    This place will be where the food is dropped off. How will it be dropped off?
    Up in the ceiling there will be a small little tube that connects to the kitchen.
    Right next to that transportation would be a device. The user would simply put the table number
    so that the machine would know where to go. Once they insert that information the tubes will start to
     expand to accommodate the tray's size. These plates will be magnetic so that the food can go down smoothly. </h5>
